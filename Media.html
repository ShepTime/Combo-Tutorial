	<h1>Combo Breakdown</h1>
	<p><em>Here are the moves that will comprise our combo. Once you get familiar with performing each on their own, please go to the tutorial video to see it strung together.</em></p>
<img src="DB.gif" alt="Dragon's Breath">
<p> Our opening move for this combo will be Dragon's Breath. Pressing F+3,3,3,3 will start a low kick <a href="index.html#chain">chain</a> that will result with knocking our opponent in the air.</p>
<br>
<img src="Kontei.gif" alt="Kontei Slam">
<p>The second move of our combo is the Kontei Slam. F+2 is all that is needed for this command. The timing may be a little tricky, but a little practice will have you doing it on a consistent basis. This move has Liu Kang slam his nunchucks into his opponent with strong downward thrust, bouncing them off of the ground to continue to be <a href="index.html#juggle">juggled</a>.</p>
<br>
<img src="Loyalty.gif" alt="No Loyalty">
<p> While we have our opponent in the air, the third move, No Loyalty, is a 2-kick string used to add a little damage and prime our finishing input. use 3,4 for input.</p>
<br>
<img src="BK.gif" alt="Bicycle Kick">
<p> Finally, we <a href="index.html#cancel">cancel</a> from No Loyalty into the famous Bicycle Kick with B,F+3. This will drive the opponent back towards the corner where fighting game players hate to be. If you have enough offensive meter, pressing 
R1/RB will cause the Bicycle 
kicks to extend for a longer period of time and squeezing out that extra bit of damage. The benefit of this is you will be able to drive the enemy further into the dreaded corner. 
The only downside is when you land, you will not have as much space between yourself and your opponent like you would without the meter burn.</p>
