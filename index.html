	<h6>About Me</h6>
	<p>My name is Austin Sheppard and thank you for visiting my site. Like most fighting game fans, I enjoy a perfect execution of a combo that I spent hours working on in practice mode. A lot of times, we can naturally make
a nice combo string out of our favorite inputs. But often, we may need to see what other players are executing to help guide our own growth. In order to take your damage output to the next step, tutorials become necessary to 
get a few tools to add to your arsenal. Having a more advanced combo can help you stay ahead of competition. Hopefully the combo provided on this website will become a useful key to your future victories.

Mortal Kombat 11 is a fighting game that came out on April 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2019. It is made by Netherrealm Studios and, contrary to the title, it is the 23<sup>rd</sup> entry in a growing catelouge of games since its conception in 1992. The franchise
underwent a soft reboot with 2011's "Mortal Kombat" entry which was also a period that the company was changing from Midway to Netherrealm Studios. MK 11 is a traditional toe-to-toe fighting game with a healthy roster of characters
that provide many different playstyles for consumers to try. It is one of the consistent games that are played in popular game tournaments.

I chose Liu Kang as the combo example in this game for a few different reasons. The first being that he is one of my top three favorite characters, alongside Goro and Mileena. Another reason is that outside of the popular Scorpion
and Sub-Zero, he is one of the most known characters since he is the primary protaganist in the majority of the entries, and his likeness is derived from one of the most influential people in modern history; Bruce Lee. Along with his
appeal, he is a well rounded character with easy to learn moves. He is known as a "Rushdown" character, but he has other tools in his kit for people who may want to zone or play a different style. I enjoy his move set because of the
heavy martial arts influence and his trademark sounds when performing his moves. </p>
